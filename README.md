#PYTHON SCRIPT TO KEEP ATERNOS SERVER 24X7
###This is a python script for running your aternos (minecraft server hosting) server 24X7,but there's a catch this script will only run on your local machine
or hosting which supports script running with GUI ( i didnt found one ).

#How to setup
 clone the repo or download from zip file
 run pip install requirements.txt in terminal
 run app.py
 new chrome window will open
 ##you need to first setup a new account with a server in order to make it 24 X 7 inside the chrome window
 after setting up the server you just need to start the server and keep the script running
